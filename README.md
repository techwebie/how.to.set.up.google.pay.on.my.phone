Google Pay is Google's answer to Apple Pay â€” it lets you use your phone to make contactless payments in many stores, and also make purchases in apps and on websites. 

**Here's how to set it all up.**

1. If you don't already have it on your phone, install the Google Pay app from the Google Play store. 

2. Start the Google Pay app and then tap "Get Started" on the welcome screen.

3. Follow the step-by-step instructions to configure your Google Pay account. You'll have the opportunity to connect Google Pay to your Google account (the account you use for Gmail, YouTube, and other Google apps), which can help you take advantage of loyalty cards and online discounts.

4. When you're asked to add a payment method, you can choose to add a credit card, debit card, or PayPal account. 

5. If you add a card and want to use it to make in-store payments, be sure to enter all the card details. You might see a message that says "Set up in-store payments." Tap the link and enter any missing information.
